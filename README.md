# Digital VLSI SoC Design & Planning
VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) is the process of designing and manufacturing Integrated Circuits (ICs) that integrate thousands to billions of transistors onto a single silicon wafer. These transistors are interconnected to form highly complex circuits that perform specific functions, ranging from simple arithmetic operations to advanced data processing.
### VLSI design flow
The VLSI design flow is a structured methodology for developing integrated circuits efficiently and effectively. It guides designers through key stages, including specification, design entry, synthesis, verification, layout, and fabrication. The flow aims to minimize design time while ensuring high-quality and reliable products. By breaking the process into manageable tasks, it helps focus on specific design aspects at each stage. This approach streamlines the workflow, reduces errors, and boosts team productivity.
